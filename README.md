ðŸ“¨ MQ and Database Integration in IBM App Connect Enterprise
This repository contains a fully implemented IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) solution that processes messages from IBM MQ, transforms them using Graphical Data Mapping, and stores the result in IBM DB2. It supports COBOL and XML message formats via data models defined in a shared library and uses external policy definitions for JDBC database connectivity.
